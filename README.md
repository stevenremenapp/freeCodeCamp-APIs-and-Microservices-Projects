## Intro

This is a repository to collect my freeCodeCamp APIs and Microservices Certification projects.

## Certification

## Projects Completed:

    <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-file-metadata-microservice-project-666"><h2>Project can be found here</h2></a>
    
    API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp

    ### User stories:
    1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
    2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
    3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

    ### Usage :
    * Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

  <summary>2) Timestamp microservice</summary>

    API Project: Timestamp Microservice for FCC

    ### User stories :

    1. The API endpoint is `GET [project_url]/api/timestamp/:date_string?`
    2. A date string is valid if can be successfully parsed by `new Date(date_string)` (JS) . Note that the unix timestamp needs to be an **integer** (not a string) specifying **milliseconds**. In our test we will use date strings compliant with ISO-8601 (e.g. `"2016-11-20"`) because this will ensure an UTC timestamp.
    3. If the date string is **empty** it should be equivalent to trigger `new Date()`, i.e. the service uses the current timestamp.
    4. If the date string is **valid** the api returns a JSON having the structure 
    `{"unix": <date.getTime()>, "utc" : <date.toUTCString()> }`
    e.g. `{"unix": 1479663089000 ,"utc": "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 17:31:29 GMT"}`.
    5. If the date string is **invalid** the api returns a JSON having the structure `{"unix": null, "utc" : "Invalid Date" }`. It is what you get from the date manipulation functions used above.

    #### Example usage:
    * https://curse-arrow.hyperdev.space/api/timestamp/2015-12-15
    * https://curse-arrow.hyperdev.space/api/timestamp/1450137600000

    #### Example output:
    * { "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }

  <summary>3) Request header parser microservice</summary>
    <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-request-header-parser-microservice-666"><h2>Project can be found here</h2></a>
    
    API Project: Request Header Parser Microservice for freeCodeCamp

    ### User stories:
    1. I can get the IP address, preferred languages (from header `Accept-Language`) and system infos (from header `User-Agent`) for my device.

    #### Example usage:
    * [base_url]/api/whoami

    #### Example output:
    * `{"ipaddress":"159.20.14.100","language":"en-US,en;q=0.5","software":"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0"}`

  <summary>4) URL shortener microservice</summary>
    <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-url-shortener-microservice-project-666"><h2>Project can be found here</h2></a>
    
    API Project: URL Shortener Microservice for freeCodeCamp

    ### User Stories

    1. I can POST a URL to `[project_url]/api/shorturl/new` and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response. Example : `{"original_url":"www.google.com","short_url":1}`
    2. If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http(s)://www.example.com(/more/routes)` format, the JSON response will contain an error like `{"error":"invalid URL"}`. *HINT*: to be sure that the submitted url points to a valid site you can use the function `dns.lookup(host, cb)` from the `dns` core module.
    3. When I visit the shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

    #### Creation Example:

    POST [project_url]/api/shorturl/new - body (urlencoded) :  url=https://www.google.com

    #### Usage:

    [this_project_url]/api/shorturl/3

    #### Will redirect to:

  <summary>5) Exercise Tracker</summary>
      <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fcc-exercise-tracker-666"><h2>Project can be found here</h2></a>
      
      Exercise Tracker REST API

      #### A microservice project, part of Free Code Camp's curriculum

      ### User Stories

      1. I can create a user by posting form data username to /api/exercise/new-user and returned will be an object with username and _id.
      2. I can get an array of all users by getting api/exercise/users with the same info as when creating a user.
      3. I can add an exercise to any user by posting form data userId(_id), description, duration, and optionally date to /api/exercise/add. If no date supplied it will use current date. Returned will be the user object with also with the exercise fields added.
      4. I can retrieve a full exercise log of any user by getting /api/exercise/log with a parameter of userId(_id). Return will be the user object with added array log and count (total exercise count).
      5. I can retrieve part of the log of any user by also passing along optional parameters of from & to or limit. (Date format yyyy-mm-dd, limit = int)
